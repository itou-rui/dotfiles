Please optimize the selected code based on the following objectives:

- Improve code execution speed
- Reduce memory usage
- Reduce CPU usage
- Reduce battery consumption

**Important**:

- If no optimizations can be found, explain the reason and end this task.
- If optimizations are made, explain the reasons and the expected results (e.g., "This change is expected to reduce execution time by approximately XX seconds.") and then end this task.

Please optimize the natural language content in the selected range based on the following criteria:

- Replace ambiguous expressions with clear and specific wording to improve clarity
- Remove redundant sentences and retain only necessary information for conciseness
- Ensure consistency by unifying terminology and style
- Select the most effective expressions according to the context to maintain alignment with the intended purpose
- Improve readability by organizing sentence structure and word order for easier understanding

**Important**

- Do not change any code, variable names, or function names
- Do not localize the language of the selected range
- Do not alter the original meaning or intent
- Maintain technical accuracy
- If no optimization is found, provide a concise explanation for the absence of optimizations.
