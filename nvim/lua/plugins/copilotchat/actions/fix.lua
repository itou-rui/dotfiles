	Bug = [[
Please fix bugs in the selected code range, paying attention to the following points:

- Use the stack trace from `vim_register_0` as the primary clue.
- If the selected range does not provide enough information, note that "the user has not identified the cause," and in this case, use the provided information to the fullest extent to identify the cause.
- Since the provided file is likely related to the cause of the bug, also consider its definitions and references.
- Keep the scope of the fix to a minimum.

**Important**:

- If `vim_register_0` is not provided, respond only with `"**Copy the stack trace to the clipboard**"` and end this task.
- After correcting the bug, explain its location, root cause, and the reason for the correction. If necessary, conclude with an ASCII art diagram illustrating the bug's flow.
]],

	Diagnostics = [[
Please fix the "diagnosed" issues in the selected range based on the following instructions:

- Determine whether it is appropriate to address the diagnosed issues by considering the provided related files and code
- Apply software principles
- If the diagnosed issues affect other parts of the code, also fix those affected areas

**Important**:

- If the diagnosed issues affect other parts of the code, also fix those affected areas
- Maintain compatibility to avoid breaking existing functionality
- Avoid negative impacts on performance
- If you make changes to areas not directly diagnosed, briefly explain the reason for those changes
- If you determine that it is not appropriate to address the diagnosed issues, briefly explain the reason
]],

	Issues = [[
Please identify and fix the following types of issues in the selected range:

- Logic Errors: Infinite loops, logical mistakes in conditionals, incorrect use of operators
- Boundary Errors: Out-of-bounds array access, null/undefined references, division by zero
- API Misuse: Incorrect argument order in functions, misunderstanding of return values, use of deprecated methods
- Type Errors: Failed type conversions, type mismatches, insufficient type checking
- Asynchronous Processing Errors**: Missing awaits, unhandled Promises, race conditions
- Memory Leaks: Failure to release resources, forgetting to remove event listeners
- Security Issues: Insufficient input validation, SQL injection, XSS vulnerabilities
- Performance Issues: Redundant processing, use of inefficient algorithms

**Fixing Procedure**

1. Identify the Issue: Clearly describe the discovered problem
2. Analyze the Impact: Assess the effect on related files
3. Implement the Fix: Provide code that resolves the issue
4. Suggest Tests: Indicate how to verify that the fix works correctly

**Important**

- Use the information from related files to help identify issues
- Carefully consider the fix to avoid introducing new problems
- Maintain compatibility and do not break existing functionality
- Clearly explain the reason for the fix and the expected effect
- If no problems are found, reply "**There were no problems with the selected code!**" to conclude the response.
