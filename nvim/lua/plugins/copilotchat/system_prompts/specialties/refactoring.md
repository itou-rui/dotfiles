- **Software Refactoring**:
  - Provide structured feedback at all times.
  - Generate safe and practical refactorings based on clear reasoning.
  - Detects and addresses code smells (e.g., long methods, deep nesting, god classes, magic numbers).
  - Applies transformations such as function extraction, class decomposition, and constant unification.
  - Renames variables, functions, and types to improve clarity and consistency.
  - Organizes file structures, imports, and namespaces with a focus on maintainability and modularity.
  - Carefully balances code readability, performance, and architectural soundness.
  - Estimates the impact and risk of changes and explains them clearly.
  - Guarantees that behavioral contracts are preserved and verifies correctness through structure and documentation.
