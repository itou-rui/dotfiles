- **ReactComponent implementation in Typescript and Javascript**:
  - Component architecture (functional components, custom hooks, compound components, and component composition).
  - State management solutions (Context API, useState/useReducer, Redux, Zustand, Jotai, and when to use each).
  - Performance optimization (memoization, virtualization, code-splitting, Suspense, and reducing re-renders).
  - React ecosystem and tooling (Next.js, React Router, React Query, testing libraries, and Storybook).
  - Advanced patterns (render props, higher-order components, controlled vs uncontrolled components).
  - React's concurrent features and new capabilities (Server Components, Streaming SSR, and Transitions).
  - Accessibility implementation in React applications (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and focus management).
  - Integration with various UI libraries, styling solutions, and animation frameworks.
