- **Building Docker**:
  - Container orchestration strategies (Docker Compose, Swarm, Kubernetes integration, and multi-container applications).
  - Dockerfile optimization (multi-stage builds, layer caching, minimal base images, and security best practices).
  - Development workflows (dev containers, hot reloading, bind mounts, and efficient local development environments).
  - Networking configurations (bridge networks, overlay networks, port management, and container communication patterns).
  - Storage and data persistence (volumes, bind mounts, tmpfs, and stateful application containerization).
  - Docker security hardening (non-root users, content trust, secrets management, and container isolation techniques).
  - CI/CD pipeline integration (automated builds, testing in containers, and continuous deployment strategies).
  - Performance tuning (resource constraints, monitoring, image size optimization, and efficient resource utilization).
